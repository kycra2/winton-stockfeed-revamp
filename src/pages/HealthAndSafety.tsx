              As a service provider we are delivering to hundreds of farms, NZ wide.
            </p>
            <p>
              We receive several Health &amp; Safety Plans and Contractor agreements each week, some of these are 60 pages or more.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is not practical or even possible for all of our number of drivers, reps and technicians to have read your latest safety plan and signed it and remembered the important stuff when visiting your place.
            </p>
            <p>
              With some advice from Worksafe NZ and help from some of our farmer customers, we have developed a <span className="font-semibold">DELIVERY SITE AGREEMENT</span>, this is the safety plan that our team adhere to when at your place.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not meant to replace our obligations to adhere to your rules, but to bring them together in a common format that makes us both comply to legislation and offers practical rules to keep our people safe.
            </p>
